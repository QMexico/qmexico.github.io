Andrea, originally from Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua, is currently a Eugene P. Wigner Fellow at the Physics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the US. She earned her Ph.D. in Particle Physics from Texas A&M University, where she was also part of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). 

Andreaâ€™s research at ORNL is interdisciplinary, focusing on the intersection of quantum computing and particle physics. Her work combines a scientific interest in extending knowledge of the fundamental blocks of the universe and how they interact with each other; as well as building analysis tools for high-energy physics experiments, including machine learning and quantum computing.
Andrea is also an advocate for diversity and inclusion in the STEM fields, and she is currently chair of Women in Physical Sciences.
