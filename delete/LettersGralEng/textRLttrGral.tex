We are happy to inform you that your application to our workshop {\verb|QBronze39@Mexico|} on Quantum Computing and Programming has been accepted. You will find below practical information about the workshop and how to participate.
Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the mentors or organizers immediately. We are all here to take part in the program and also learn, study, talk, and share about quantum, and education and science in general.


Our workshop is organized online and we use Discord as the base platform. Please use this link to join our Discord server as the first step: {\url{https://discord.gg/MATaeWD}} 
In Discord you will see all announcements and be able to ask your questions to mentors and share your comments, outcomes, and progress. We will also share the links for daily zoom meetings on Discord.


Our tutorial and recorded video lectures are in English, but the zoom meetings will be in Spanish. All mentors can speak both English and Spanish, and so you can use both languages during the workshop.


We will use the Strangeworks platform for easy access to Qiskit Quantum Development Kit (QDK) without having to worry about dependencies, libraries, Python versions, etc. To create your Strangeworks account for the workshop, click here:
{\url{https://app.quantumcomputing.com/signup?org=QMexico}} 


If you prefer, you can also configure your own computer to work with the tutorial Bronze locally. For this purpose, download the tutorial here and then follow the installation instructions:  {\url{https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/basics-of-quantum-computing}}


There will be an installation session at 18:00 - 19:00 on Saturday Oct 31st, Mexico City Time. You can also use the Discord channel \verb|#installation-help| to ask for help.

We share these information on Discord as well and so you will be able to access them during the workshop.

Feel free to ask questions, and have a nice time before and during the workshop!
